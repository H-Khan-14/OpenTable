1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

This coding challenge was fairly difficult but altogether engaging. Excluding the time I spent ruminating and thinking of how I would complete this challenge I would say it took me about 6-8 hours between breaks. While I am proud of my final solution there is always room for improvement. I could have done a better job designing and making the UI/UX experince better rather than what I have currently. If I had more time I would also make further improvements in the applications responsiveness, further use more robust and better test my application for points of improvement or errors and eliminate them. I would also add a .env file node environment to make it better as well as abstract away the API URL.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

Of React 16 one of the more useful features that I use is the Context API component structure. One of the main headaches associated with older versions of React is the problem of prop drilling. React App's provide the benefit of having many different components that can be organized into many layers that the developer would have to drill through to ensure that the props were passed through to the necessary components. Another React 16 feature that I use are hooks. Hooks are in essence a way to utilize React functionality and state without having to write a class. This has many benefits such as: not having to restructure, not having to create multiple wrappers/layers of providers, consumers, components, props and others.

3.  How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

The best way that I would track down a performance issue in production would be to use a DevTool Lighthouse auditing. Using it would allow you to track down the performance issue. I have not have had to do this.

4.  How would you improve the API that you just used?

There are several points of improvement in the OpenTable API. There could have been better error handling (making them more descriptive), the API also did not include the types of food or the rating of the restaurant. Having a functioning API that returns information based on the documentation. The price filter does not work as described in the documentation. Overall just improving the API documentation and better description of the API itself and it's parameters.
